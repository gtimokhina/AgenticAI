# Perfect Peach Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- Homemade Pie Crust or All Butter Pie Crust (both recipes make 2 crusts, 1 for bottom and 1 for top)
- 8 cups (about 1.4kg) peeled chopped peaches, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 2/3 cup (135g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (63g) all-purpose flour OR 1/4 cup instant tapioca
- 1 Tablespoon (15ml) fresh lemon juice
- 1–2 teaspoons peeled minced fresh ginger (optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 Tablespoons (28g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- Egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk
- Optional: coarse sugar for sprinkling on crust

## Instructions
1. Make the crust: Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5.
2. Make the filling: In a large bowl, gently stir the chopped peaches, granulated sugar, flour, lemon juice, ginger, and cinnamon together until thoroughly combined. Set filling in the refrigerator while you roll out the dough. No need to cover it.
3. Adjust the oven rack to the lower-third position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Place a baking sheet on the bottom oven rack to catch any bubbling-over juices.
4. Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn dough a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place dough into a 9-inch round pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers to smooth it. Pour and spread filling evenly into pie dish. Dot butter pieces on top of filling. Set aside at room temperature or in refrigerator while assembling top crust.
5. Arrange the lattice: Roll out the other disc of chilled dough to 12-inch circle. Cut strips of dough about 2 inches wide. Weave strips over and under one another to form lattice. Trim excess dough and fold bottom crust edges over lattice edges. Crimp or flute edges with a fork.
6. Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with egg wash. Sprinkle with coarse sugar if using.
7. Bake at 425°F for 20 minutes. Then reduce oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Place a pie crust shield on edges to prevent over-browning. Continue baking 45-50 minutes until filling is bubbling throughout. Internal temperature should be about 200°F (93°C) when done. If crust browns too fast, tent with foil.
8. Remove from oven and cool on a rack for at least 4 hours before slicing and serving. Filling needs time to set.
9. Cover leftovers tightly and refrigerate up to 5 days.

Enjoy your perfect homemade peach pie!
