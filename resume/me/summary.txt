My name is Gulnara Timokhina. I'm a software engineer and data scientist. 
I'm originally from Russia, but I moved to San Jose.
I am an individual with a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and global experiences. My interests include exploring a wide variety of cuisines, traveling to new destinations, hiking in nature, and engaging with people from different backgrounds. These passions not only enrich my personal life but also foster a broader worldview and a strong sense of connection with others.
